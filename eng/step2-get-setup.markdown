## What we're building

So we are going to learn HTML & CSS by creating a simple recipes website with a few pages.

![Tiny Cakes!](../assets/css-fixed-homepage.png){:title="Tiny Cakes!" class="img-responsive imgbox"}

## Setup

Create a folder somewhere on your computer that makes sense for you and call it `learn-html-workshop`.
Everything we create in this workshop will be created in that folder.
It could be on your desktop, or your documents folder, or wherever.

Now open Atom.  If this is the first time you have launched it it display the Welcome Guide.
Close those two tabs for now.

Go to the `File` menu, select `Add Project Folder`, browse to your `learn-html-workshop` folder and click `open`.

Now you should see the Project view open on the left side with your folder visible.

![Creating a project in Atom](../assets/atom-blank.png){:title="Creating a project in Atom" class="img-responsive imgbox"}

Now we will create the three files that we will be working on.  The file names are:

 * `index.html`
 * `traditional-cupcakes.html`
 * `muffins.html`

To create a new file in Atom, right-click on the folder in the Project view, select `New File` from the menu, and type in the filename in the popup-box.

As each file is created it will be automatically opened in a new editor tab by Atom.

![Empty files in Atom](../assets/atom-empty-files.png){:title="Empty files in Atom" class="img-responsive imgbox"}

Once you have created all three new files, open each one by selecting it in the Project view (or clicking on its tab if it's already open) and pasting in the following content below.

Each file has its own block of content to add.

![Content added to files](../assets/atom-unformatted-files.png){:title="Content added to files" class="img-responsive imgbox"}

Don't forget to save each file as you make changes.  You can save using the `File` menu, `ctrl`-`s` on Windows/Linux, or  `CMD`-`s` on macOS.  

Hint: When an file in Atom has unsaved content you will see a little blue dot on the right on it's tab.
