Hey you did it!  

![Congratulations!](../assets/leo-congrats.gif)

You now know the basics of using HTML & CSS to build webpages.

Congratulations!

But we have of course only just touched the surface today.  There is so much more you can learn about just HTML and CSS.

So what to do now?

1. You can build your own HTML pages about whatever you want.
2. Upload your pages to a free hosting service like <https://neocities.org/> and show them off to your family and friends. If you heard about GitHub, check GitHub Pages.
3. Learn more about HTML & CSS at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn>

Or if you are feeling confident you can move straight onto the the [JavaScript workshop](http://add.url) and learn how to build the same site as a server-side application with NodeJS.
