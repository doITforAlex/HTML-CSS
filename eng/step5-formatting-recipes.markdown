Ok now that our homepage is looking better lets get our recipe pages looking nice.

Let's do `traditional-cupcakes.html` first.

Instead of showing you the completed page I'm going to provide some direction and let you figure out the right markup.

1. The document title should be `Traditional Cupcakes`.
1. `Traditional Cupcakes` in the first line should be a level 1 heading.  Remove the line of `-`.
2. Before the level 1 heading, put a link back to our `index.html` with the text of `HOME`.
2. Description should be a paragraph.
3. Make `Ingredients:` a level 2 heading. The ingredients should be in an unordered list.
4. `Method:` should be a level 2 heading as well, but the method directions should be an ordered list.

Step 7 of the method is trickier, right? The good news is, you can nest most things inside of list items - including other lists.  

When you're done, your file should look something like this:

![The marked-up cupcakes page](../assets/browser-cupcakes-formatted.png){:title="The marked-up cupcakes page" class="img-responsive imgbox"}

Refer to our completed `traditional-cupcakes.html` for hints.

How did you go?

Now do `muffins.html` as well.  Use the same directions plus the following:

1. Make sure the document has an appropriate title.
2. `Variations:` should be a level 2 heading.
3. Each variation name (i.e. Blueberry, Pecan, etc.) should be a level 3 heading.
4. Make the variant steps an unordered list.

When you're done, your file should look something like this:

Ok.  Now we have our three pages: two recipes and a homepage.

But it's a bit plain isn't it?  Most recipe sites have images.  Let's look at them in the next step.
